A social media share tooltip to boost interactions with your content and increase post shares. 

== Description ==
Highly is a tooltip for direct interaction with your blog's content. Readers can highlight any text to share it with their network on social media or save it for later. The Highly tooltip supports sharing to LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.

Why hide social media sharing buttons at the bottom of your posts when you can make sharing easier for your readers by allowing them to directly share their favorite quotes. 

With the Highly plugin you can make your site more interactive and increase site shares!
